<!-- ? For most buttons you see on the internet , if we hover over them with our mouse , they change their style slightly , some get darker , some get lighter , and this is what we are going to learn here.-->


<!-- * When we hover over a button and they change their style, will help us learn about hovers. -->
<!-- ! when we hover in and out, they would change their style smoothly , which will help us learn about transitions. -->
<!-- ? When we hover over a button, which casts a little bit of shadow , will help us practise shadows. -->

Shadow is just another css property - box-shadow.
In its simplest use, you only specify a horizontal and a vertical shadow. The default color of the shadow is the current text-color.
"a" in rgba stands for alpha- the value of opacity.
Third value of the box-shadow stands for blur and makes the shadow blurred
when first 2 value are 0, the shadow is under the button , that is why we cannot see it then. */
