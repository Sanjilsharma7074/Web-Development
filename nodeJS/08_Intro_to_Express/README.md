As we can see, the callback function used while creating the server has become increasingly complex and difficult to manage, even though we haven't implemented anything substantial yet.

The complexity arises due to the following reasons:

We need to handle each route separately and specify the HTTP methods explicitly.
Parsing query parameters requires an entirely different module, such as the url module.
We will need to integrate multiple packages in the future to handle various functionalities.
To simplify this process, Express.js provides a more structured and efficient approach.

With Express:

We no longer need a separate module to parse query parameters; Express handles it seamlessly.
Express automatically creates the server, and we simply need to use the listen function to make it accessible in the browser.
This makes backend development more organized, reducing complexity and improving maintainability.
