As we can see, the callback function used while creating a server in Node.js has become increasingly complex and difficult to manage, even though we haven't implemented any major functionality yet.

Key Challenges:
Each route must be handled separately, requiring explicit specification of HTTP methods.
Parsing query parameters requires an additional module, such as the url module.
Multiple packages will be needed in the future to manage different functionalities.
To streamline this process, Express.js provides a more structured and efficient approach.

By comparing server.js (built with Express) and index.js (pure Node.js), it becomes evident how Express simplifies backend development, making it a powerful and time-saving framework.

Advantages of Express.js:
Eliminates the need for a separate module to parse query parameters, as Express handles it seamlessly.
Automatically creates the server, requiring only the listen function to make it accessible in the browser.
This enhances code maintainability, reduces complexity, and significantly improves development efficiency.
